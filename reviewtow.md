## Summary
 Deponia is a indie, point&click game about a boy who lives in a literal garbage town called deponia. Rufus lives with his ex-girlfriend that enjoys his misery in a town where everyone knows him for the half-wit that he is. Despite his eagerness to leave the garbage planet for a mysterious oasis most people in town ard heavily convinced that he will never be blessed with paradise. No deponian ever has. Throughout the game Rufus use his harebrained plans to try to get off the island and into the Elysium. Through one of his schemes he ends up meeting an elysian named Goal and accidentally bring her down to Deponia. Along the journey he befriends Goal, to a point, who agrees help him get to Elysium if he can get her back to her fiance. Goal and Rufus travel through all different areas before eventually finding her fiance. In the process Rufus discovers an earth-shattering secret.
 
The game begins with a tutorial that explained the mechanics that you’ll use throughout the whole game. You learn how to examine objects that you fine and use them individually or combine it with another, or multiple objects to create a bigger object to use. It also shows you how to interact with other people and choose different dialogue options to get things to happen. You also learn that by interacting with different things you can either cause different events to happen or you can discover new items to work with. There are alot of different puzzles that you do in the game which does take some getting used to. Simple actions become more elaborate when you have to try to figure what items to use and where on your own. However there are alot of different clues that does make it a lot easier.

The game has a very interesting and unique soundtrack that completely fits with the game and will stay in your head long after your done playing. And each of the members in the town, and other places you visit, have such very unique personalities and qualities that it’s hard to not want to know as much about them as you can. While there aren’t that many different locations you get to see, they each have a lot to do in them and a lot to discover. The story itself is very linear so once you’ve played it there isn’t much to see. That also means that you will get to discover everything that the game has to offer and you’ll never be left wondering what else may be out there to find.

## Final Thoughts
Essentially this was a really fun game that kept me engrossed for many hours of fun. The story of it seemed pretty well throughout and they ended the game with an opportunity for a sequel( which I’ve also started to play). This is the type of game that i can see myself playing for a while ( especially considering that they already have 4 games out). I would have liked for the game to have been a bit longer but for the wonderfully discounted price I received of $1.99 there are absolutely no complaints I can really make. I enjoyed a lot of the effort they it shows they put in with the graphics. The main mechanic of the game and animation seemed to be really well worked out. Though it was sometimes difficult to figure out exactly what I should be doing with the items I had and when but it was mostly part of the fun. Ultimately I am very glad that I took a chance on it and it leaves me open to do it more in the future.
