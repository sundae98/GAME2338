## Summary
The game is about two characters, Watergirl and Fireboy who are trying to get through a temple. There are other versions of the game all of which start watergirl and fireboy but in different locations. Each of the location ar like different levels or stories. There doesn’t seem to be much of a plot to it other than the two characters getting to the end. 

The way the game works is that water girl is made of water and fireboy is made of fire. They each have the properties of of the elements they are made of. Watergirl is able to walk through water but dies in fires. Fireboy is able to walk through fire but dies in water. They have to go through the different levels of the game and finish the temple. 

In the ice temple there is a new element of ice. Watergirl cant run fast one ice but can climb up ice slopes. Fireboy can run fast on ice but cant climb up icy slopes. Later in the game there are different elements like mirrors that reflect light to either melt the ice or freeze the water. 


## Final Thoughts

I like the game. I know that it’s supposed to be a game that can be played as a multiplayer game but the controls can get a little confusing if you play the game by yourself. Even as a multiplayer game it’s hard to play when you have two people working on the same keyboard. Other than that I liked it. It was a fun differentiation that the game levels work like a branching system rather than as a linear progression.
