## Details

### Game Title
Just Dance 2018, https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/just-dance-2018-switch/.

### Rating
I give this 9 out of 10 songs.

## Summary

This game doesnt really have a plot to it. It's a party game that you can use to play with your friends or by yourself. There has been 10 different verisions of the game starting in 2009 with just dance going all the way to 2019 with Just Dance 2019. 
The way 
This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
