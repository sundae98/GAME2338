## Details

### Game Title
Just Dance 2018, https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/just-dance-2018-switch/.

### Rating
I give this 9 out of 10 songs.

## Summary

This game doesnt really have a plot to it. It's a party game that you can use to play with your friends or by yourself. There has been 10 different verisions of the game starting in 2009 with just dance going all the way to 2019 with Just Dance 2019. 

The way this game works for the switch is that you're able to use the joy cons to select a game. After selecting a song, depending on the song you pick, you can choose the character that you play as. Before the game starts you place the joycon in one hand, you're dominant hand, that you will use to dance in the game. Once the screen comes on there was be a background that is vaguely inspired by that song playing. There will be a character that show you dance moves that you have to play. In the bottom right corner there are a series of images that show you the moives you have to make before you make them.

While you play the game the system keeps track of how accurate your moves were, allowing your points bar to move up and gain more stars accorndingly. Once the game is over it will cound the point total, and that of your friend if you're using multiplayer, and give you levels and rewards based on this. Just Dance 2018 has a very large selection of songs from the year 2018 and different playlest for hours of fun.



## Final Thoughts
I like that this game included a multiplayer function that allows me to play with my best friends. The best feature is the Just Dance premium that allows you to play all of the Just Dance song ever made. the only thing that I dont like about the game is that Just Dance premium has a subscription plan.
