## Summary
This game is about a character(that you design and create) that works in a mostly deadend job in the city. One day this character (who for simplicity will be referred to as she) receive sa letter from her grandfather who advises her to open the letter when life in the city becomes most unbareable. This point does eventually come and she finds out that her grandfather has died and left her his farm. After arriving in the farm she has the option of many different farm life activities. She's given some seeds to start her off and is allowed to pursue her life as she desires.
In the game you do things from learn how to farm, to get married, to fighting in the dungeon. There are many different possible activities other than just farming that you can do to always keep you active. There are also time sensitive events in game to try to make sure that you stick around for a while to unlock them. There seems to me a linear story that goes on as the characters plays as well as repeatable events. However the game is primarily open world (as small as that world may be).
Besides farming youre able to craft object, sell items, go fishing, get married, fight in dungeons and decorate your house. Sprinkled throughout the game are little mysteries that are always fun to discover. Its possible to complete all of the side objectives and keep playing them but the main objective of the game seems to be to just live the life that you want to while on the farm in anyway you can. Whether it be through selling fishes, mined items, crafted object or just crops from farming, living a peaceful and quiet life is possible.


## Final Thoughts
I really like this game. It allowes me to live out my fantasy of living on a farm and the type of lifestyle that somes with it while adding some features of regular rpg gaming that kept me interested. the main features that I didnt particularly like was the friendship status decrease. This feature made is so that if you dont interact and gift things to people alot then they stop liking you. This feature took away from the game because with all of the things that you could do already it made it hard to juggle all of the different activities and dedicate a day to doing more than trying to make friends.
