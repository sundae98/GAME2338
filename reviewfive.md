## Summary
This game is about a young girl named Mae that just dropped out of college and has come back to her hometown, Possum Spring, maybe to stay. She ends up back in her old room in her parents attic and tries to get back in touch with her old friends while living life as she would have in the past before she left. While in town she catches up with her old friends before things in town take a turn for the worse. 

Bea is a crocodile type humanoid that now works as a manager in one of the stores. Even though she started to work her way up the later and make a good life for herself, she still resents Mae for squandering the opportunity that she got to go to college. Bea is a part of the band that Mae and her friends had. Even though she enjoys the responsibilities that she has and the work she does, she can never fully get over the negative side of life.

Angus and Greg are a couple that are also a part of the band. They live together in an apartment near their jobs. Even though Greg is the more immature one, he still does what he can to help Angus get through the hard things in life he’s going through. This include moving to a new town away from Mae in an attempt to fully start their lives together. 

Mae, despite having the best opportunity to better herself, seems to be stuck in the past trying to relive her glory days before she left. She sleeps all morning, plays games all night and wonders around unemployed to her friends’ jobs to spend time with them. This being her first few weeks back she starts to have a great time rekindling her cracking friendship until one night. On Halloween night, Mae witnesses a kidnapping of one of the citizens and enlists her friends help to find out what’s going on in the town.



## Final Thoughts
I did like that game. I thought it was an interesting story. It’s really cool to be able to play through Mae’s dreams and try to interpret them. By playing as Mae we get learn more about Mae and how she views herself in society and among her friends. It’s a nice slow game to just get to know a person and how she lives. The main problem is that the story may be a little too slow. Because of this, it’s a little hard to really get into it. It’s not until hours in that you actually see someone get kidnapped for the “plot” to really kick off. Throughout most of the game it doesn’t even seem like there is a plot(but i don’t know if that’s how it was meant to be). Through most of the game I spent a lot of time just going through and not actually knowing what I was supposed to do. But it eventually came to realize that it may have been mimicking life in general.
